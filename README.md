Project Overview
Smart Train Finder is a web application designed to simplify train travel planning between Hamburg and Amsterdam. The application helps users compare different train options based on price, duration, and convenience factors. While currently in development, the foundation has been laid for a production-ready solution with robust deployment practices.

Key Focus Areas:

User-friendly interface for trip planning

Performance optimization through caching

Containerized architecture for consistency

DevOps best practices for deployment

Current Status
🚧 Development in Progress 🚧

The current implementation includes:

Complete Docker-based local development environment

Frontend UI with search form and results display

Backend API server with Redis caching layer

Mock data system for demonstration purposes

What's not yet implemented:

Integration with Deutsche Bahn/Trainline APIs

Real-time train schedule fetching

Production deployment to cloud environment

Advanced filtering and sorting features

API Integration
The application is designed to integrate with train schedule APIs. Currently, we're using mock data, but the architecture supports seamless integration with:

Potential Data Sources
Deutsche Bahn Fahrplan API - Primary data source

Trainline API - Alternative data source

Amadeus Travel APIs - Backup option

The Redis caching layer is implemented to:

Reduce API calls to external services

Improve response times

Handle rate limits effectively

Future Roadmap
Short-term Goals
Integrate with Deutsche Bahn API

Implement real-time data fetching

Add sorting/filtering capabilities

Enhance UI/UX with loading states

Set up CI/CD pipeline

Mid-term Goals
Deploy to production (Vercel + Railway)

Implement user authentication

Add favorite routes functionality

Integrate with weather API for trip planning

Add multi-language support

Long-term Goals
Expand to other European routes

Mobile app development (React Native)

Price prediction algorithm

Integration with hotel booking APIs

Carbon footprint calculator
